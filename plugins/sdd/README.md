# SDD (Specification-Driven Development) Plugin

A comprehensive workflow plugin for Claude Code that enables specification-driven development practices. This plugin helps you define project governance, create detailed feature specifications, map codebases, plan implementations, generate tasks, and execute with quality gates.

## Acknowledgments

This plugin is based on [Spec Kit](https://github.com/github/spec-kit) by GitHub, Inc. (MIT License). SDD started as a custom fork of spec-kit's commands and templates, adapted and extended with new features and modified workflows, while maintaining the core spec-driven development philosophy.

This plugin was also influenced by concepts from [Get Shit Done (GSD)](https://github.com/glittercowboy/get-shit-done) by TÂCHES (MIT License), particularly its approach to codebase mapping.

## Features

- **Project Constitution**: Define engineering principles and quality gates through guided discovery
- **Feature Specifications**: Create detailed, testable feature specs with user stories
- **Parallel Codebase Mapping**: Analyze projects across 8 dimensions (stack, architecture, security, etc.)
- **Implementation Planning**: Generate technical plans with library selection and structure design
- **Task Generation**: Automatically create dependency-ordered, parallelizable task lists
- **Quality Analysis**: Validate consistency across specifications, plans, and implementation
- **Drift Detection**: Track codebase evolution and update artifacts when structure changes
- **Retrospectives**: Capture implementation learnings to build institutional knowledge
- **Multi-agent Execution**: Orchestrate Claude Code agents for parallel implementation
- **GitHub Integration**: Built-in git workflow with PR gates and CI verification

## Installation

1. Add the marketplace in Claude Code:
   ```bash
   /plugin marketplace add aaronbassett/aaronbassett-marketplace
   ```

2. Install the SDD plugin:
   ```bash
   /plugin install sdd@aaronbassett-marketplace
   ```

3. **IMPORTANT**: This plugin requires the `utils` plugin from the same
   marketplace for the CPR (Claude Plugin Root) resolver functionality.
   Ensure utils is installed first.
   ```bash
   /plugin install utils@aaronbassett-marketplace
   ```

## Quick Start

Here's a typical 6-step workflow for developing a new feature:

### 1. Create Project Constitution (first time only)
```bash
/sdd:constitution
```
Define your project's engineering principles, quality standards, and governance rules through an interactive discovery process.

### 2. Map Your Codebase
```bash
/sdd:map
```
Generate 8 specialized documents analyzing your tech stack, architecture, security, conventions, and more using parallel mapper agents.

### 3. Create Feature Specification
```bash
/sdd:specify user authentication with JWT
```
Build a detailed feature spec with user stories, acceptance criteria, and technical requirements.

### 4. Generate Implementation Plan
```bash
/sdd:plan
```
Create a technical plan with library selections, data models, API contracts, and architectural decisions.

### 5. Generate Task List
```bash
/sdd:tasks
```
Automatically generate a dependency-ordered, parallelizable task list organized by user story.

### 6. Execute Implementation
```bash
/sdd:implement
```
Execute tasks in phases with quality gates, automated commits, PR creation, and CI verification.

## Directory Structure

The SDD plugin organizes all artifacts in the `.sdd/` directory:

```

```

## Workflow Phases

The SDD workflow follows 8 distinct phases:

1. **Constitution**: Define project governance and engineering principles
2. **Codebase Mapping**: Analyze existing code across 8 dimensions
3. **Specification**: Create feature spec with user stories and acceptance criteria
4. **Planning**: Design implementation with tech stack and architecture
5. **Task Generation**: Create dependency-ordered, parallelizable task list
6. **Analysis**: Validate consistency across all artifacts
7. **Implementation**: Execute tasks in phases with quality gates
8. **Review**: Retrospectives and drift detection for continuous improvement

Each phase builds on previous phases and creates artifacts that inform subsequent work.
