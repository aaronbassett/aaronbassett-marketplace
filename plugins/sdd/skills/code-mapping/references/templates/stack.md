## Languages & Runtimes

List programming languages and their versions. Only include what actually runs.

| Language | Version | Purpose |
|----------|---------|---------|
| [e.g., TypeScript] | [e.g., 5.x] | [e.g., Primary application language] |

## Frameworks

List major frameworks that define the application architecture.

| Framework | Version | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| [e.g., Next.js] | [e.g., 14.x] | [e.g., Full-stack React framework] |

## Critical Dependencies

List 5-10 most important dependencies. These are packages that:
- Define core functionality
- Would require significant refactoring to replace
- Are used throughout the codebase

| Package | Version | Purpose | Usage Scope |
|---------|---------|---------|-------------|
| [e.g., zod] | [e.g., 3.x] | [e.g., Schema validation] | [e.g., All API boundaries] |

**Note**: Only specify versions when compatibility matters.

## Package Managers & Build Tools

| Tool | Version | Purpose |
|------|---------|---------|
| [e.g., pnpm] | [e.g., 8.x] | [e.g., Package management] |

## Runtime Environment

| Environment | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| Node.js | [version if specified] |
| OS Targets | [e.g., Linux containers, macOS, Windows] |
| Deployment | [e.g., Docker, serverless, bare metal] |
