# Creative Commons Licensing Guide

Complete guide to Creative Commons licenses for documentation, media, and non-code content.

## What is Creative Commons?

**Creative Commons (CC)** is a nonprofit organization that provides free, easy-to-use copyright licenses for creative works including text, images, video, music, and other non-software content.

**Purpose:** Make it easy to share and build upon creative works while retaining attribution and control.

**Key difference from software licenses:** CC licenses are designed for creative content, not source code. For code, use MIT, Apache, GPL, etc.

## Choosing the Right CC License

### Decision Tree

**Question 1: Do you want to give away all rights (like public domain)?**
- YES → **CC0** (no attribution required)
- NO → Continue

**Question 2: Should people give you credit/attribution?**
- NO → **CC0** (reconsider - you probably want credit)
- YES → Continue (all others require attribution)

**Question 3: Should commercial use be allowed?**
- NO → Continue to Question 4A (NonCommercial path)
- YES → Continue to Question 4B (Commercial allowed path)

---

**Question 4A (NonCommercial path): Should derivative works be allowed?**
- NO → **CC-BY-NC-ND** (most restrictive)
- YES → Continue to Question 5A

**Question 5A: Should derivative works also be non-commercial?**
- YES → **CC-BY-NC-SA** (non-commercial copyleft)
- NO → **CC-BY-NC** (non-commercial, derivatives can vary)

---

**Question 4B (Commercial allowed path): Should derivative works be allowed?**
- NO → **CC-BY-ND** (sharing only, no remixing)
- YES → Continue to Question 5B

**Question 5B: Should derivative works use the same license?**
- YES → **CC-BY-SA** (copyleft, like GPL for content)
- NO → **CC-BY** (most permissive with attribution)

## Common Questions

**Q: Can I use CC licenses for software code?**
A: No, not recommended. CC licenses are designed for creative content, not software. Use MIT, Apache, GPL, etc. for code.

**Q: CC-BY or CC-BY-SA for documentation?**
A: CC-BY for maximum adoption. CC-BY-SA if you want derivative docs to stay open (like GPL).

**Q: What does "NonCommercial" really mean?**
A: Vague. Generally: not for profit/commercial advantage. But gray areas exist (ad-supported blogs, commercial training using materials).

**Q: Can I change the license later?**
A: You can change license for future versions, but already-released versions stay under their original license.

**Q: What if I use CC-BY-SA content in CC-BY content?**
A: The combined work must be CC-BY-SA (ShareAlike is "viral" like copyleft).

**Q: How do I apply a CC license?**
A: Include LICENSE file, mention in README, optionally add to each file footer.

**Q: CC-BY-3.0 or CC-BY-4.0?**
A: Use 4.0 - it's the current version with improved clarity and international compatibility.

**Q: Can I dual-license content?**
A: Yes, offer content under multiple CC licenses (e.g., CC-BY-4.0 or CC0, user chooses).

## CC License Compatibility

### Combining Works

| Original → Derivative | CC0 | CC-BY | CC-BY-SA | CC-BY-NC | CC-BY-ND |
|---------------------|-----|-------|----------|----------|----------|
| **CC0** | ✅ CC0 | ✅ CC-BY | ✅ CC-BY-SA | ✅ CC-BY-NC | ✅ CC-BY-ND |
| **CC-BY** | ❌ | ✅ CC-BY | ✅ CC-BY-SA | ✅ CC-BY-NC | ✅ CC-BY-ND |
| **CC-BY-SA** | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ CC-BY-SA | ❌ | ❌ |
| **CC-BY-NC** | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ CC-BY-NC | ✅ CC-BY-NC-ND |
| **CC-BY-ND** | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ CC-BY-ND |

✅ = Compatible
❌ = Incompatible

**Key rules:**
- ShareAlike requires derivative to also be ShareAlike
- NoDerivatives prevents remixing
- NonCommercial requires derivative to also be NonCommercial
- Can always be more restrictive, rarely less

---

## Best Practices

### For Documentation

**Recommended: CC-BY-4.0**
- Allows commercial use (companies can use)
- Allows derivatives (translations, adaptations)
- Requires attribution (you get credit)
- Maximum adoption

**Alternative: CC-BY-SA-4.0**
- If you want improvements to stay open
- Like GPL for content
- Prevents proprietary derivatives

### For Educational Content

**Recommended: CC-BY-4.0**
- Removes barriers to education
- Allows commercial educational use
- Enables translations
- Wide distribution

**Alternative: CC0**
- For datasets and facts
- When attribution burden is too high
- Maximum reuse

### For Creative Works

**Varies by artist:**
- **Maximum exposure**: CC-BY-4.0
- **Prevent commercial exploitation**: CC-BY-NC-4.0
- **Preserve originals**: CC-BY-ND-4.0
- **Full control**: All rights reserved (no CC)

### For Scientific Content

**Recommended: CC-BY-4.0 or CC0**
- Science advances through reuse
- Data should be freely available
- Attribution appropriate for papers
- CC0 for raw data

## Summary

**Most common recommendations:**

1. **CC-BY-4.0** - Default for most content (documentation, tutorials, educational materials)
2. **CC-BY-SA-4.0** - When you want "copyleft" for content (wikis, collaborative resources)
3. **CC0** - For datasets and when attribution is burdensome

**Avoid unless specific need:**
- CC-BY-NC (limits educational and business use)
- CC-BY-ND (prevents improvements)
- CC-BY-NC-ND (most restrictive, rarely appropriate)

**Golden rule:** Choose the least restrictive license that meets your needs. More restrictions = less reuse.

**For code:** Don't use CC - use MIT, Apache, GPL, etc.

**For documentation:** CC-BY-4.0 is the best default choice.
